Quantum pre-processing filter for binary image classification

This repository contains MATLAB scripts for performing binary image classification using a quantum pre-processing filter (QPF) and neural networks.  Four datasets are used as follows:
- MNIST (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
- EMNIST (https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/icns/resources/reproducible_research3/publication_support_materials2/emnist)
- CIFAR-10 (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
- GTSRB (https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/)
